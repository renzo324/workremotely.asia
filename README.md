# workremotely.asia

Workremotely.asia is a personal project.
# What is it for
It aims to curate a board of joblistings what are 1. Based in or around asia 2. Remote in nature.
# Why I made it
This project started because I wanted something like Remoteok.io but focused on a specific region (asia).
For now as a proof of concept this project will be using the RemoteOK api. In the future I will create a web scraper to get the data I need.
# Who it is intended for
This project is intended mostly for myself but also for all the people who want to get started with remote work but have no idea where to start looking within asia
